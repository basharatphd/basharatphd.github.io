## Course Description  
This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and practices essential for designing and architecting robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.  

### Key Topics Covered:  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:  
  Fundamentals of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in software design.  

- **GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)**:  
  Principles for assigning responsibilities to classes and objects in object-oriented design.  

- **SOLID Principles**:  
  Best practices for creating maintainable and scalable object-oriented systems.
  
- **Software Design Patterns**:  
  Reusable solutions to common software design challenges, covering creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.  

- **Architectural Styles**:  
  Exploration of layered, microservices, event-driven, and other architecture styles for modern applications.  

- **Requirements Analysis and Design**:  
  Translating software requirements into high-level designs with an emphasis on clarity and precision.  

- **Design Trade-offs**:  
  Balancing scalability, performance, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness in software design.  

### Learning Outcomes:  
By the end of the course, students will:  
- Understand and apply object-oriented principles, design patterns, and architectural styles.  
- Use GRASP and SOLID principles to create well-structured and maintainable software systems.  
- Develop the ability to analyze requirements and design scalable software solutions.  
- Gain hands-on experience in applying design concepts to real-world software projects.  

This course emphasizes practical learning through projects and case studies, preparing students to meet industry demands for high-quality software development.

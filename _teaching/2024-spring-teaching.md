## Course Description  
This advanced course delves into the practices of DevOps and the architecture of cloud computing, with a dedicated focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It equips students with the skills to design, deploy, and manage scalable and resilient applications using AWS tools and DevOps methodologies.  

### Key Topics Covered:  
- **DevOps Fundamentals**:  
  - Overview of the DevOps lifecycle: continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation.  
  - Core principles: collaboration, agility, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  

- **Version Control and CI/CD Pipelines**:  
  - Hands-on with Git and GitHub for source control.  
  - Building CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.  

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:  
  - Automating infrastructure provisioning with AWS CloudFormation.  
  - Managing configurations and environments using AWS Systems Manager.  

- **AWS Cloud Foundations**:  
  - Introduction to AWS core services: EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda.  
  - Exploring AWS compute, storage, and networking services.  

- **Containerization and Orchestration**:  
  - Building and managing containers using Docker on AWS.  
  - Deploying and scaling applications with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).  

- **Monitoring and Logging**:  
  - Application and infrastructure monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch.  
  - Centralized logging using Amazon OpenSearch Service (formerly Elasticsearch).  

- **Security and Compliance**:  
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access control.  
  - DevSecOps best practices and AWS security tools (e.g., AWS Inspector, KMS).  

### Learning Outcomes:  
By the end of the course, students will:  
- Master AWS services for deploying and managing cloud-based applications.  
- Build CI/CD pipelines using AWS tools for seamless integration and deployment.  
- Automate infrastructure provisioning and management using AWS CloudFormation.  
- Design and scale containerized applications using Docker and Amazon EKS.  
- Monitor and optimize system performance using Amazon CloudWatch.  
- Implement security best practices within AWS environments.  

### Hands-On Labs and Projects:  
- Develop a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy for a real-world application.  
- Automate infrastructure setup with AWS CloudFormation templates.  
- Deploy and manage containerized microservices using Amazon EKS.  
- Configure and analyze application performance using CloudWatch and OpenSearch Service.  

This course bridges the gap between DevOps principles and practical cloud computing skills, enabling students to excel in AWS-based DevOps roles.

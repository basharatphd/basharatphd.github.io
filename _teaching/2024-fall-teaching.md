## Course Description  
This course focuses on the principles of software design and analysis, emphasizing the use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) and design patterns for building high-quality software systems. It combines theoretical concepts with practical implementation in Java.  

### Key Topics Covered:  
- **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**:  
  - Use case diagrams for capturing requirements.  
  - Class and object diagrams for system structure representation.  
  - Sequence and activity diagrams for modeling dynamic behavior.  
  - State diagrams for lifecycle modeling.  

- **Object-Oriented Design Principles**:  
  Core principles like encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity in designing software systems.  

- **Design Patterns**:  
  - Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory.  
  - Structural Patterns: Adapter, Decorator, Composite.  
  - Behavioral Patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command.  

- **Java Implementation**:  
  - Practical coding exercises implementing design patterns in Java.  
  - Case studies to analyze and refactor existing systems using UML and patterns.  

- **Software Analysis Techniques**:  
  - Requirements elicitation and validation.  
  - Identifying design trade-offs and ensuring system robustness.  

### Learning Outcomes:  
By the end of the course, students will:  
- Understand and apply UML diagrams to analyze and design software systems.  
- Implement key design patterns to solve real-world software challenges.  
- Develop proficiency in Java for object-oriented design and pattern implementation.  
- Analyze software requirements and translate them into maintainable designs.  
- Gain the ability to critically evaluate and improve software architectures.  

This course emphasizes hands-on learning through Java-based projects and encourages students to bridge theory with practice in software design and analysis.

# Where to find good researchers and their teams?
This is a list of collaborators and/or people I admire... incomplete, and in no particular order.

### The Sys. Id. Crowd
- [Prof. Xavier Bombois, École Centrale Lyon, France](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en/contacts/xavier-bombois), works on System Identification and is also CNRS Research Director with Laboratoire Ampere.

### The Modelica Crowd
- [Prof. Peter Fritzon, Linköping Univ., Sweden](http://www.ida.liu.se/~petfr27/) leading the [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org) effort.
- [Dr. Dietmar Winkler, HSN, Norway](http://me.dwe.no), expert in all Modelica [things](https://github.com/dietmarw), and member of [OpenIPSL](http://openipsl.org)
- [Dr. Michael Tiller](https://www.xogeny.com) Modelica-guru and modeling code-master at Xogeny! Inspiration engine for the software-peasants like myself.

### The Power Systems Crowd 
- [Dr. David Laverty, QUB, Belfast](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/EPIC/Profile/?name=david.laverty), leading the [OpenPMU](http://faraday1.ucd.ie) project.
- [Prof. Mario Paolone, EPFL, Switzerland](https://people.epfl.ch/mario.paolone), leading the [DESL](https://desl-pwrs.epfl.ch).
- [Prof. Federico Milano, UCD, Dublin](http://faraday1.ucd.ie) creator of PSAT and DOME.
- [Dr. Barry Rawn, CMU Africa, Rwanda](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/rawn-barry.html), personal website [here](http://www.barryrawn.info/academic/).
... more to come!

# Where to get a PMU? - Build one!
- I have tried helping a bit my friend [Dr. David Laverty](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/EPIC/Profile/?name=david.laverty) in his great effort developing and open source software/hardware PMU device and ecosystem which you can find [here](https://sites.google.com/site/openpmu/).
- The FluxPMU is the result of this effort, it revisits OpenPMU version 1 (legacy), and offers a ``Maker's Guide'' and documentation on the LabVIEW Software, [here](https://github.com/ALSETLab/FluxPMU)
 
# What tools you use in your research that are not made by yourself?
## Modelica and the FMI Standard
- [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org): developing the Modelica language standard and FMI standard.
- [FMI Website](http://fmi-standard.org): providing info on the FMI standard.
- [OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org): Open Source Modelica Consortium and the OSS OpenModelica environment.
- [Dymola](https://dymola.com/), the first and oldest Modelica compliant tool.
- [Modelon's](http://www.modelon.com) tools and libraries rock!
- [Wolfram System Modeler](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/), runs Modelica models in Linux, Mac OS/X and Windows.
- [Papyrus](https://eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/): Papyrus-RT provides an implementation of the UML-RT modeling language together with editors, code generator for C++ and a supporting runtime system and model-compare (diff/merge) capabilities.
- [LBL's Simulation Research Group Tools at GitHub](http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov) and [GitHub Account]
(https://github.com/lbl-srg): The Simulation Research Group specializes in the research, development and deployment of software that support the design and operation of buildings, as well as the research of next-generation building energy and control systems.
- [Python Migration](http://bci2000.org/downloads/BCPy2000/Migration.html): list of tips and resources for migrating from Matlab to Python-based systems using NumPy and SciPy.
## Python
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda): environment for Python and R that includes several pre-installed libraries and tools (e.g. Spyder and Jupyter).
## System Identification Tools
- [RaPId Toolbox](https://github.com/ALSETLab/RaPId), MATLAB-based (unfortunately), but very special as we made with my students...
- [DSI Toolbox](https://github.com/ftuffner/DSIToolbox) MATLAB-based (unfortunately).
- [CONTSID Toolbox](http://www.contsid.cran.univ-lorraine.fr) MATLAB-based (unfortunately).
# What can I use to learn Modelica...
## Modelica Learning Resources
- [modelica.university](http://modelica.university/res/apps): Interactive web-based Modelica models and simulation showcases. ** See ** the ``Tour of Modelica``.
- [Modelica in Action](https://github.com/mbonvini/ModelicaInAction)  create, compile and simulate Modelica models using JModelica.org.

### ***2024-08-14:*** Notice to Prospective Researchers and Students 
I will NOT be recruiting any students to join my team for Spring 2025. The earliest that I will be looking for students to join my team will be to join during Fall 2025.

Please do not email me with requests and questions about joining my research program until the Fall 2025 admissions period, because I will not have available funding to support additional students. See more information [here](https://alsetlab.github.io/students/).

### About this Website
This is the website of Prof. Luigi Vanfretti and ALSETLab (a research group and a laboratory) at the department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.

**If you are a student, and would like to enquire how to join my team, please see this page:** [Join!](https://alsetlab.github.io/students/)

### About ALSETLab
ALSETLab is the name of Luigi's research group and also the real-time hardware-in-the-loop laboratory facility built for research at RPI. The acronym stands for (ALSET: Analysis Laboratory for Synchrophasor and Electrical energy Technology) and (Lab: for Laboratory). Click on "The Lab!" in the navigation bar to see what "The Lab!" is all about.

``Note: although the acronym is more of an excuse for using the name of Nikola Tesla... read ALSET backwards!``

### About Luigi Vanfretti
Luigi Vanfretti received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electric power engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA, in 2007 and 2009, respectively. He is a Full Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, since July 2022, where he was a tenured Associate Professor from 2017-6/2022-6. At RPI, he leads research projects in his laboratory and with his research team, ALSETLab, in the domains of electrical power systems and aircraft electrification.

Professor Vanfretti has held temporary posts in prestigious international institutions, in 2019 he was a Visiting Faculty at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; in 2022 he was a Visiting Professor at both the Laboratoire Ampère of the École Centrale de Lyon and the SuperGrid Institute, both located in Lyon, France, and from 2023-2024 he was Visiting Faculty at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs., Cambridge MA. He has also been a Visiting Researcher during summer of 2023 at Laboratoire Ampère of the École Centrale de Lyon and the SuperGrid Institute, both located in Lyon, France, 

In addition to his academic duties, through Vanfretti Consulting LLC, Dr. Vanfretti serves as a consultant for utilities and research institutions, including Dominion Energy in VA, the SuperGrid Institute in Lyon, France, and CENACE (the power system operator of Ecuador), Quito, Ecuador, to name a few.

Prof. Vanfretti was an Assistant Professor,  Associate Professor (tenured) and a Docent with the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, from 2010 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2017, respectively, where he led the SmarTS Lab (a research group).

He was with Statnett SF, the Norwegian transmission system operator, from 2013 to 2016, as a Special Advisor with the Research and Development Department and as a Consultant, from 2011 to 2012 and in 2017.

His research interests are in “electrified systems,”' and include cyber-physical system (CPS) modeling, simulation, stability and control in the domains of power grid and electrified transportation, both vehicles and infrastructure. In addition, he performs research on synchrophasor technologies, both on technology development and data analytics, and is interested in the application of software technologies, signal processing, system identification and machine learning for design and operation analytics for CPS.
